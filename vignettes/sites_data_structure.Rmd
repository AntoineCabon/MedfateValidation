In this vignette the sites/plots data structure needed for the automated
calibration/validation of the medfate model is explained.

## Data files format

Files must be in `txt` format, with headers, without rownames, separated
by tabs (`"\t"`) and with point (`"."`) as decimal character.
Also, names of the files must start with the site/plot code.

## Needed files

Each site/plot data can be comprised of 9 files, some of them being optional:

- treeData
- shrubData (*optional*)
- seedData (*optional*)
- miscData
- meteoData
- soilData
- terrainData (*optional*)
- customParams (*optional*)
- measuredData

In the following sections each file will be described in detail using `FOO` as
site code

## treeData

> Name: FOO_treeData.txt  
  Location: Sites_data/FOO/

This data file must have 6 columns and the same number of rows as tree species
present in the site/plot:

Species | N | DBH | Height | Z50 | Z95
--------|---|-----|--------|-----|------
54 | 168 | 37.55 | 800 | 750 | 3000
68 | 384 | 14.60 | 660 | 750 | 3000

Variables:

  : **Species** A numeric code as found in the SpParams data from the `medfate` package
  : **N** Species density
  : **DBH** Mean diameter at breast height for the species
  : **Height** Mean height for the species
  : **Z50** Depth in mm enclosing the 50% of the roots
  : **Z95** Depth in mm enclosing the 95% of the roots

## shrubData

> Name: FOO_shrubData.txt  
  Location: Sites_data/FOO/

This file is optional. If not supplied the shrub slot of the `forest` object
will be emtpy.  

File must have 4 columns and the same number of rows as shrub species present
in the site/plot:

Species | Cover | Height | Z
--------|-------|--------|----
64 | 3.75 | 30 | 2000
78 | 30.00 | 100 | 1000

Variables:

  : **Species** A numeric code as found in the SpParams data from the `medfate` package
  : **Cover** Percent cover of the species
  : **Height** Mean height for the species
  : **Z** Depth in mm of the root system for the species
